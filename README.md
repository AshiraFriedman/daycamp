# daycamp
I run a daycamp during the summer for two seperate halves. 
Now that my daycamp is growing, I would like to create a database to help me keep track of all the camper details.

I am asking for database table scripts to implement this database table.
## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.sql.
## Deliverables
The following files are required to implement this. The info needed is in the spec. 
1. Database.sql
2. Table.sql
3. Data.sql
4. Reports.sql
## SQL Requirements
- Primary key
- Properly named columns
- Proper data types
- Not null as appropriate
- Constraints
- Files should be able to run repeatedly so include drop and use statements
